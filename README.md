## About this project

Godt.no is a simple project that demonstrates usage of clean architecture with MVP pattern. To see my approach to clean architecure with MVVM pattern see [Daily Set Solver](https://github.com/bskierys/DailySetSolver).

## What does this app do?

[Godt.no](https://www.godt.no/) is Norways most popular food website. The site contains food recipes, restaurant reviews, customer blogs/opinions and food articles.

This app consist of a simple list of the first 50 recipes in the godt api, containing title, image, description and ingredient names. It is possible to search for a recipe based on the ingredients or title of the recipe and the app works offline after parsing the feed for the first time.

## Architecture

Project is using clean architecture along with MVP pattern. It's also written entirely in kotlin with support from RxJava.

**What is clean architecture?**
The Clean Architecture demonstrates strategies to help solve or avoid common problems. It is designed to be testable, independent from UI, database or any external data source. Read more in articles below:
